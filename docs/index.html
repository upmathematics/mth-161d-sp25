<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
<div id="description" class="section level3">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This course introduces you to the discipline of statistics as a
science focused on understanding and analyzing data. Throughout the
semester, you will learn how to effectively harness data to navigate
uncertainty –exploring how to collect, analyze, and interpret data to
draw meaningful conclusions about real-world phenomena. Emphasizing
commitment to ethical reasoning and critical thinking, the course will
prepare you to apply statistical methods to address complex problems in
various academic and professional fields.</p>
</div>
<div id="core-course-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Core Course Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland offers a liberal arts UP Core Curriculum
with a vision of students acquiring knowledge, skills, and values that
will prepare you to respond to the needs of the world and its human
family, while having a foundation of multiple lenses to address enduring
questions of human concern. The UP Core achieves this vision by
cultivating six habits of heart and mind in all UP graduates regardless
of major.</p>
<p>As a priority for this UP Core class, our focus is the following
habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use scientific thinking to understand how the world works.</li>
<li>Employ mathematical and/or statistical models and techniques to make
sense of data and solve problems.</li>
<li>Use empirical analysis to address human, social or ecological
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of developing that habit this course will prioritize students
learning to the learning outcomes listed below. Toward this end, one
specific UP Core learning outcome for this class is that students who
complete this course will be able to apply basic statistical techniques
to collect, organize, analyze, and interpret data, and to effectively
communicate the results of such analyses in addressing real-world
problems.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-outcomes" class="section level3">
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>Upon completion of the course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand and articulate the fundamental structure of data, how it
is collected, and evaluate its limitations and their impact on the
validity of inferential results.</li>
<li>Present data effectively using graphical methods and compute key
descriptive statistics.</li>
<li>Apply statistical techniques to analyze individual variables or
explore relationships between multiple variables, while correctly
interpreting the results in context.</li>
<li>Use linear regression models appropriately and provide contextual
interpretations of the findings.</li>
<li>Explain the core principles of random variables and probability
theory.</li>
<li>Critically assess claims and make informed decisions based on
data-driven evidence.</li>
<li>Develop and execute basic R code for data analysis, statistical
modeling, and data visualization.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Help Hours</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Alex John Quijano</p>
<ul>
<li>Walk-in Monday to Friday at 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM, Buckley Center
279</li>
<li><a href="https://calendly.com/alexjohnquijano/helphours"
target="_blank">One-to-One, Buckley Center 279 or in Teams</a>
<br><em>Click on the link to sign-up for a 15-minute session.</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>My walk-in help hours start week 2. Note that you can bring a fellow
student with you when you sign-up for a session. Just click the “Add
Guests” link when you sign-up, and add in your fellow student’s UP
email. If you need more than 15 minutes, you can book at least two
consecutive sessions.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-learning-commons" class="section level3">
<h3>The Learning Commons</h3>
<p>You can get academic assistance through Learning Commons tutoring
services and workshops. The Co-Pilot peer tutoring program provides you
with opportunities to work with other students to get help in writing,
math, group projects, and other courses. Schedule an appointment to meet
with a Co-Pilot (tutor) by visiting the <a
href="www.up.edu/learningcommons" target="_blank">Learning Commons</a>
website. You can also meet with a Co-Pilot during drop-in hours. Check
the Learning Commons website or drop by the Learning Commons in BC 163
to learn more about their services. Find a tutor at the Learning Commons
to get support on your academic journey.</p>
</div>
<div id="math-resource-center" class="section level3">
<h3>Math Resource Center</h3>
<p>Appointment-based tutoring accepts appointments starting week 1 and
sessions start week 2. Visit the <a
href="https://www.up.edu/learningcommons/tutoring-services/math-resource-center/index.html"
target="_blank">Math Resource Center</a> website to sign-up for an
appointment. Drop-in tutoring is Monday to Thursday, 3:00 PM - 7:00 PM
in BC 163 and starts week 2. Check the Math Resource Center website or
drop by the center for more information.</p>
</div>
<div id="help-hours-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Help Hours Guidelines</h3>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you attend the walk-in help hours or
set up a one-to-one meeting with the me if you feel like you are falling
behind during our in-person class activities, or if you just need to
clarify concepts discussed in class. In order to be more productive
during a one-to-one meeting (or the walk-in help hours), these are three
recommendations before you come in:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all gaps in knowledge you have (missed concepts) or list all
concepts that were unclear to you during class. We will address them one
by one.</li>
<li>Prepare questions you want answered and be ready to show relevant
materials.</li>
<li>Regarding assignments, prepare to show (a) what are the steps you
have tried and (b) what are the errors you encountered and the
strategies you have tried.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are recommendations so that you can get the most out
of the help hours allocated for you. If you just want to come in and
chat about something else, feel free to do so. If the dedicated time for
one-to-one meeting does not work for you, send me a message to set up an
appointment.</p>
</div>
<div id="collaboration-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>I expect you to participate in the class through lectures, class
activities, discussions, homework, and other engagements. I also expect
you to make use of opportunities to get help outside of class (help
hours, Teams, email, tutoring) if you need help. Concise and specific
messages are the most helpful so I know how I can best help you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are encouraged to participate in discussions with your peers
regarding assignments. However, each student must take responsibility
and ownership of their work and submit their work individually, except
for group projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You may not collaborate during assessments but you are permitted to
access the textbook, Posit Cloud, Teams, and the internet.</p>

<div id="standards-based-grading" class="section level3">
<h3>Standards-Based Grading</h3>
<p>Learning statistics demands focus, rigorous examination of the
concepts you have encountered, and a process of ongoing refinement and
improvement. You will be assessed on your proficiency in statistical
thinking, scientific reasoning, and inference. You will have
opportunities to demonstrate your proficiency, revise your work, and
reflect on your growth in analyzing data, interpreting results, and
making data-driven conclusions.</p>
<p>This course uses a standards-based grading system, which emphasizes
mastery of specific learning objectives. This approach is more precise
and motivating than traditional grading methods and fosters a more
equitable learning environment. Key features of standards-based grading
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear focus on mastering defined learning objectives</li>
<li>The use of diverse assessment methods to evaluate understanding</li>
<li>Regular, detailed feedback to guide your progress</li>
<li>Support in setting meaningful goals and tracking your growth</li>
</ul>
<p>This system prioritizes learning and personal development, enabling
you to excel and reach your highest potential.</p>

<h2>Assignments</h2>
<div id="submission-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>Your work must be labeled correctly and clearly written. Homework and
worksheets can be electronically hand-written or typed but must be
uploaded to Moodle as a single pdf or html file. If you choose to
handwrite your answers on paper, scan your document using a scanner app
to ensure the text is clear. I recommend using the ‘Adobe Scan’ app,
which is available for both Android and iOS.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You need to submit your homework and worksheet assignments online
through Moodle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The assessments will be given during class. Depending on the learning
objective, assessments must be submitted physically or online through
Moodle. They will then be returned to students with feedback through
Moodle.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="worksheets" class="section level3">
<h3>Worksheets</h3>
<p>There will be worksheets every Wednesday and Friday. The purpose of
the worksheets is for in-class group work and activities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must submit your worksheet individually by end-of-class or
end-of-day. Your name must exist in your worksheet and the names of your
collaborators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worksheets are marked mostly on completion, and partially on
correctness. It will be marked either pass or fail, there will no
detailed feedback on worksheets, and no opportunities for revisions and
make-up.</p>
</div>
<div id="homeworks" class="section level3">
<h3>Homeworks</h3>
<p>Homework is assigned every other Monday. The purpose of the homework
is to provide practice with problems, and it will include tasks that
involve R. Some homework assignments include specific learning
objectives that will be assessed separately from the main content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must submit your homework individually by the end of the day on
Friday of the week it is assigned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Homeworks are marked using the general grading guide and will be
returned with detailed feedback.</p>
</div>
<div id="homework-revisions" class="section level3">
<h3>Homework Revisions</h3>
<p>You can revise your homework for an up-grade, meaning - for example -
a grade of “NI” can be up-graded to “A”.</p>
<p>Here are the qualifications and requirements for homework
revisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A homework mark of “NMI”, “NI”, “A”, or “E”.</li>
<li>The revised homework must be completed, meaning all parts should
have your full written solutions.</li>
<li>Homework marked with “M” is disqualified for revisions, but you can
still use them as practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the rules for homework revisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homework revisions are accepted within one week of the homework
being returned to you, otherwise the grade is set.</li>
<li>You can revise your homework multiple times as long as it is not
marked as “M”.</li>

<p>Assessments are given every other Monday after a short summary
review. The purpose of the assessments is to evaluate your understanding
of the learning objectives. Each assessment is specifically designed
according to the learning objective being assessed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assessments are administered during class after a short summary
review, and you have the entire class period to work on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assessments are marked using the general marking guide and will be
returned with detailed feedback. Your work will be marked according to
these three components:</p>

<div id="assessment-retakes" class="section level3">
<h3>Assessment Retakes</h3>
<p>Your assessments can be revised and you can retake it. Retakes allows
you to have your assessments up-graded, meaning - for example - a grade
of “NI” can be up-graded to “A”. The purpose of retaking an assessment
is to reflect on the feedback from your previous attempt and learn how
to correct any mistakes.</p>
<p>Here are the qualifications for assessment retakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An assessment mark of “NMI”, NI”, “A”, or “E”.</li>
<li>The revised assessment must be completed, meaning all parts should
have your full written solutions. Incomplete work is disqualified for
retakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the rules for assessment retakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retakes must be done within one week of the assessment being
returned to you, otherwise the grade is set.</li>
<li>If you need to retake an assessment more than one week of the exam
being returned to you, let me know for a discussion.</li>
<li>Completed revisions of the previous assessment must be provided
before you can retake it.</li>
<li>If you need to retake an assessment more than once, you are required
to sign-up a one-to-one help hour session with me for a discussion
before you can sign up for another retake.</li>
<li>You can retake assessments multiple times as long as it is not
marked as “M”.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expectations</h2>
<div id="deadline-extension-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Deadline Extension Policy</h3>
<p>If you need more time to submit an assignment, you may request an
extension by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with me at least 12 hours before the deadline.</li>
<li>Specify the exact day you plan to submit your work or the number of
extra days you need.</li>
<li>Please ensure that you adhere to the established timeline for
submitting assignments, as it is important to maintain fairness and
avoid over-reliance on extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submitting a few hours late is usually not a major issue, as long as
I receive your work before I begin marking and providing feedback. An
extension is not required in such cases. Extensions for in-class
assignments –such as worksheets, mini-assignments, or activities– will
only be granted if I decide to extend the deadline for the entire
class.</p>
<p><em>Amendment 5: The sentence “If you need more time to submit a
homework assignment, you may request an extension by following these
steps:” was changed to “If you need more time to submit an assignment,
you may request an extension by following these steps:”.</em></p>
<p><em>Amendment 6: The sentence “Extensions for worksheets will only be
granted if I decide to extend the deadline for the entire class.” was
changed to “Extensions for in-class assignments –such as worksheets,
mini-assignments, or activities– will only be granted if I decide to
extend the deadline for the entire class.”</em></p>
</div>
<div id="late-assignments" class="section level3">
<h3>Late Assignments</h3>
<p>You are expected to turn in all completed assignments on time.
Circumstances that may disallow you to turn in your work on time - such
as a medical reason - are understandable. Please let me know if you have
missed the deadline way beyond its original posted date without prior
communication regarding extensions. Because every assignment is an
important aspect of your learning in this class, we will discuss when
you will turn in the assignment as well as decide upon an acceptable
consequence for your turning it in late. I am committed to successfully
helping you learn from this course.</p>
<p><em>Amendment 7: The “Late Assignments” subsection was
moved.</em></p>
<p><em>Amendment 8: The sentence “Please let me know if you are unable
to submit your work and have missed the deadline way beyond its original
posted date.” was modified to “Please let me know if you have missed the
deadline way beyond its original posted date without prior communication
regarding extensions.”</em></p>
</div>
<div id="withdrawal-procedures" class="section level3">
<h3>Withdrawal Procedures</h3>
<p>It is the student’s responsibility to drop the course if he or she is
no longer planning on attending the course or filling the other course
requirements. In order to drop, the student must use and Add/Drop form
available at the Registration Office. If a student does not properly
withdraw from a course, he or she may receive an <strong>F</strong> for
the course. A properly withdrawn student will receive a
<strong>W</strong>. The last day to withdraw is <strong>Monday, April
14th</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="appointment-cancellation-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Appointment Cancellation Policy</h3>
<p>You can cancel your appointments, but it is strongly recommended that
you cancel 24 hours before your scheduled time so that other students
can schedule when a spot opens. You can reschedule for a different day
and time if you need to.</p>
<p>Please try to show-up to any of your appointments. If you have
extenuating circumstances, please let me know as soon as possible to
discuss next steps.</p>
<p><em>Amendment 9: The title was changed from “Appointment Cancelation
Policies” to “Appointment Cancellation Policy”.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="attendance-and-participation" class="section level3">
<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
<p>Attendance is not tracked. However, participation is highly
recommended. You are expected to actively participate in this class.
Participation includes coming to class on time, being prepared, being
willing to ask questions and share ideas, setting up study groups
outside of class, attending tutoring sessions, posting helpful resources
online, and contributing to the Teams discussion channels. Group and
individual presentations of ideas is a suggested component of
participation.</p>
</div>
<div id="absences" class="section level3">
<h3>Absences</h3>
<p>Generally, students are expected to attend all class sessions
according to the instructor’s direction. Students who feel unwell should
NOT attend class in person. These students should inform their
instructor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Should the instructor need to miss class, the course may be
temporarily conducted remotely. Should the instructor be unable to teach
for an extended period of time, the respective department or unit will
find a substitute to continue the course.</p>
</div>
<div id="incompletes" class="section level3">
<h3>Incompletes</h3>
<p>An incomplete “I” will only be considered when the quality of a
student’s work is satisfactory (C- or better), but for some essential
reason the course has not been completed by the student. An “I” is
reserved for emergency situations only. To request an incomplete, the
student must submit a typed, signed and dated letter stating the
reason(s) why an incomplete is appropriate. The letter should also
contain the conditions for the completion of work. Acceptance of the
request shall be at the discretion of the instructor, Department Chair,
and/or Dean of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland strives to make its courses and services
fully accessible to all students. Students are encouraged to discuss
with their instructors what might be most helpful in enabling them to
meet the learning goals of the course. Students who experience a
disability are also encouraged to use the services of the Office for
Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic
Resource Center (503-943-8985). <strong>If you have an AES Accommodation
Plan</strong>, you should meet with your instructor to discuss how to
implement your plan in this class. Requests for alternate location for
exams and/or extended exam time should, where possible, be made two
weeks in advance of an exam, and must be made at least one week in
advance of an exam. Also, if applicable, you should meet with your
instructor to discuss emergency medical information or how best to
ensure your safe evacuation from the building in case of fire or other
emergency. All information that students provide regarding disability or
accommodation is confidential. All students are responsible for
completing the required coursework and are held to the same evaluation
standards specified in the course syllabus.</p>
</div>
<div id="code-of-academic-integrity" class="section level3">
<h3>Code of Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a diverse academic community of
learners and scholars who are dedicated to freely sharing ideas and
engaging in respectful discussion of those ideas to discover truth. Such
pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present
truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that
they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another student’s
assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without
proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity.</p>
<p>Especially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical
responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or
other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit
assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are
original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines
for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the
specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also
maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at <a
href="libguides.up.edu/cite"
target="_blank">https://libguides.up.edu/cite</a>.</p>
<p>The misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated
as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or
cheating. Faculty are responsible for including a written “Course AI
Policy” in their syllabi that clearly states what they consider
appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in the context of their
courses. Students are responsible for using AI in ways that do not
detract from the established learning outcomes of the course. All
members of the scholarly community are responsible for demonstrating
sound judgment in discerning when and how to utilize AI in their work,
upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity.</p>
<p>Please see the University Bulletin for further information: <a
href="http://up.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2022-2023/bulletin/University-Academic-Regulations/I-Code-of-Academic-Integrity/Guidelines-for-Implementation-of-the-Universitys-Code-of-Academic-Integrity"

</div>
<div id="course-ai-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Course AI Policy</h3>
<p>The use of generative AI — such as Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT — is
encouraged and allowed in all of its capacity. However, students must
use these tools ethically and responsibly. To use generative AI
responsibly in this class, students should grasp underlying concepts,
acknowledge AI’s assistance, protect data privacy, verify information,
and uphold academic honor code. AI should be seen as a learning aid, not
a replacement for critical thinking.</p>
</div>
<div id="referencing-and-citation-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Referencing and Citation Guidelines</h3>
<p>In your written work for this course, you must cite all sources of
information that you use, whether they are direct quotes, paraphrases,
or summaries. The style of citation that you use should be consistent
throughout your paper. The citation styles for this course are APA or
CSE.</p>
<ul>
<li>APA style is used in the social sciences and psychology. It is
characterized by parenthetical citations that include the author’s last
name and the year of publication. For example, “According to Smith
(2023), the average height of a man in the United States is 5’10”.”</li>
<li>CSE style is used in the natural sciences and engineering. It is
characterized by numbered citations that are listed at the end of the
paper. For example, “[1] Smith, J. (2023). The average height of a man
in the United States. Journal of Human Biology, 55(2), 123-132.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure which citation style to use, please consult with
me. You can also find more information about APA and CSE style in the
Clark Library citation guidelines: <a
href="https://libguides.up.edu/cite"
target="_blank">libguides.up.edu/cite</a></p>
<p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone else’s work without giving
them credit. It is a serious academic offense that can result in a
failing grade or even expulsion from school. By following these
guidelines, you can help to avoid plagiarism and ensure that your work
is properly cited.</p>

<h3>Non-Violence Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is committed to fostering a safe and
respectful community free from all forms of violence. Violence of any
kind, and in particular acts of power-based personal violence, are
inconsistent with our mission. Together, all UP community members must

<h3>Ethics of Information</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a community dedicated to the
investigation and discovery of processes for thinking ethically and
encouraging the development of ethical reasoning in the formation of the
whole person. Using information ethically, as an element in open and
honest scholarly endeavors, involves moral reasoning to determine the
right way to access, create, distribute, and employ information,
including: considerations of intellectual property rights, fair use,
information bias, censorship, and privacy. More information can be found
in the Clark Library’s guide to the Ethical Use of Information at <a

</div>
<div id="diversity-and-inclusion-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Diversity and Inclusion Statement</h3>
<p>In the study of natural and mathematical sciences, often perceived as
objective disciplines aimed at understanding the world, it is crucial to
recognize the historical biases embedded within these fields, stemming
from a limited set of privileged populations. Acknowledging the
potential existence of overt and covert biases within the course, I
emphasize that science is a human endeavor necessitating the
incorporation of diverse experiences in the pursuit of knowledge and
skill. Valuing every student irrespective of background, origin, race,
religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability status, etc., I am
committed to fostering an inclusive climate throughout the course.
Encouraging open communication about concerns or challenges, I assure
confidentiality, except for instances of academic integrity violations
or sexual harassment, which are legally mandated to be reported. Within
our classroom, diversity and individual differences are celebrated as
strengths, and the use of mathematics as an analytical tool to challenge
power, privilege, and oppression is supported. It is our collective
responsibility to create a welcoming space where ideas can be challenged
while maintaining respect for individuals.</p>

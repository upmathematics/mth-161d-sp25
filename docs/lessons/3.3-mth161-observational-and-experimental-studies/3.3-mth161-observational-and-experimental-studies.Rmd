## Previously... (2/3)

**Relationship Between Variables**

$$\text{explanatory variable} \xrightarrow{\text{might affect}} \text{response variable}$$

**Associated vs Independent Variables**

* When two variables show some connection with one another, they are called <span style="color:blue">**associated**</span> or <span style="color:blue">**dependent**</span> variables.

* In general, <span style="color:blue">**association does not imply causation**</span>, and causation can only be inferred from a randomized experiment.

**Types of sampling**

* Most commonly used random sampling techniques are <span style="color:blue">**simple**</span>, <span style="color:blue">**stratified**</span>, and <span style="color:blue">**cluster**</span> sampling.

## Previously... (3/3)

The guiding principle of statistics is statistical thinking.

## Types of Studies

| **Observational** | **Experimental** |
|:---|:---|
| Researchers <span style="color:blue">**observe**</span> subjects without interference. | Researchers <span style="color:blue">**intervene**</span> by applying treatments to subjects. |
| No treatment or manipulation is imposed. |  Includes a <span style="color:blue">**control**</span> and <span style="color:blue">**treatment**</span> groups with random assignments (ideally). |
| Used to find <span style="color:blue">**associations**</span>, not causation. | Can determine <span style="color:blue">**causal relationships**</span>. |

**Key Difference:** Observational studies find patterns, while experimental studies test cause-and-effect.

## Case Study 1

**Is there a relationship between smoking and lung cancer?**

:::: {.column width=49%}
**Study Design:**

* Researchers select smoker and non-smoker group (or *cohorts*).
* They *observe* these participants over a long period (e.g., 20 years) *without influencing their smoking habits.*
::::

:::: {.column width=50%}
**Findings:** 

* Periodically, they record lung cancer incidence in both groups.
* If lung cancer occurs more frequently in smokers than non-smokers, researchers may conclude that *smoking is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer*.
::::

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ Since this is **observational**, it cannot prove smoking causes lung cancer --other factors (e.g., genetics, pollution) may also contribute. **However, strong correlations from multiple studies can strengthen this conclusion.**
:::

## Types of Observational Studies

| **Aspect** | **Case-Control** | **Cohort (Longitudinal)** | **Cross-Sectional** |
|:---|:------|:------|:------|
| _Study Design_ | Compares individuals with a condition (cases) to those without (controls). | Follows groups of individuals over time, observing exposures and outcomes. | Measures a population at a single point in time, observing various variables. |
| _Main Focus_ | Identifying exposures or risk factors associated with an outcome. | Observing how exposures lead to outcomes over time. | Examining the prevalence of variables or conditions at a given time. |
| _Temporal Sequence_ | <span style="color:blue">**Retrospective**</span> --looks back in time to find past exposures. | <span style="color:blue">**Prospective**</span> --follows participants forward in time. | No temporal sequence â€“ snapshot of a population at a single time point. |
| _Data Collection_ | Collects past data (often using medical records or interviews). | Collects data over time, often requiring repeated observations or surveys. | Collects data at one point in time. |

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ **Key Differences:** Case-Control looks at data in the past, Cohort follows the data, and Cross-Sectional looks at data at one point in time.
:::

## Strengths and Limitations of Observational Studies

| **Aspect** | **Case-Control** | **Cohort (Longitudinal)** | **Cross-Sectional** |
|:---|:------|:------|:------|
| _Strengths_ | Good for studying rare diseases, cost-effective, relatively quick. | Can establish temporal relationships, good for studying causes and effects. | Quick, inexpensive, good for identifying associations. |
| _Limitations_ | Cannot establish causality, relies on recall bias. | Expensive, time-consuming, and prone to participant attrition. | Cannot determine causality, only associations. |

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ **Key Similarities:** The limitation of observational studies is that it can not determine causality, only associations.
:::

## Prospective vs Retrospective Observational Studies

| **Study Type** | **Description** | **Strengths** | **Limitations** |
|:---|:------|:------|:------|
| **Prospective Study** | Researchers follow subjects forward in time, starting with an exposure and observing future outcomes. | Can establish a temporal relationship between exposure and outcome, reduces recall bias. | Expensive, time-consuming, potential participant dropout. |
| **Retrospective Study** | Researchers analyze past data, identifying subjects with an outcome and looking back to determine exposure. | Quick, cost-effective, useful for rare diseases or long-term effects. | Prone to recall bias, missing or incomplete data, cannot establish causality. |

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ **Key Differences:** Prospective means present and future data and retrospective means the past data.
:::

## Case Study II

**Is there a relationship between hypertension and stroke incidence in an older population?**

:::: {.column width=49%}
**Study Design:**

* The cases are patients aged 50+ with medical records from the past 10 years.
* Medical records are used from a hospital database, tracking blood pressure levels and stroke incidence.
* Two groups are identified based on hypertension diagnosis: hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups.
::::

:::: {.column width=50%}
**Findings:** 

* Review medical records to determine how many individuals from each group experienced a stroke within the 10-year period.
* The hypertensive group showed a significantly higher incidence of stroke compared to the non-hypertensive group.
::::

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ This is an example of a retrospective cohort Study because the data is in the past and the design involves groups.
:::

## Case Study III

**Does energy gels make a person run faster?**

:::: {.column width=49%}
**Study Design:**

* Participants are grouped into *treatment* (with energy gel) and *control* (without energy gel).
* Record the participants time lapses.
::::

:::: {.column width=50%}
**Findings:** 

* It is suspected that energy gels might affect pro and amateur athletes.
* The analysis is weak or inconclusive since there were confounding variables unaccounted such as pro vs amateur athletes.
::::

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ This is an example of an experimental study because the design involves an intervention, which is the treatment group (with intervention) and compared it to the control group (without intervention).
:::

## Case Study III: Blocking

**Does energy gels make a person run faster?** Since it is suspected that energy gels might affect pro and amateur athletes differently, we <span style="color:blue">**block**</span> for pro status.

:::: {.column width=49%}
**Study Design:**

* Divide the sample to *pro* and *amateur*
* Randomly assign pro athletes to *treatment* and *control* groups
* *Randomly assign* amateur athletes to treatment and control groups
::::

:::: {.column width=50%}
**Findings:** 

* Pro/amateur status is *equally represented* in the resulting treatment and control groups
* The analysis is stronger and they found that energy gels can provide a quick energy boost and therefore can make a person run faster.
::::

::: {style="color: blue;"}
$\dagger$ Why is is blocking important? Can you think of other variables to block for?
:::

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ Since this is an experimental study, we can conclude a causal relationship between use of energy gels and faster running.
:::

## Principles of Experimental Design

| **Principle** | **Description** |
|:---|:------|
| **Control** | Compare treatment of interest to a control group. |
| **Randomize** | Randomly assign subjects to treatments, and randomly sample from the population whenever possible. |
| **Replicate** | Within a study, replicate by collecting a sufficiently large sample. Or replicate the entire study. |
| **Block** | If there are variables that are known or suspected to affect the response variable, first group subjects into blocks based on these variables, and then randomize cases within each block to treatment groups. |

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ **Key Idea:** Experimental studies establish a cause-and-effect relationship by manipulating independent variables and observing their impact on dependent variables while controlling for confounding factors.
:::

## Blocking vs Explanatory Variables

| **Aspect** | **Blocking** | **Explanatory** |
|:---|:------|:------|
| _Definition_ | Characteristics that experimental units come with and that we want to control for. | Variables that we manipulate or observe to explain the outcome of the experiment. |
| _Purpose_ | Used to reduce variability by grouping experimental units with similar traits. | Used to explore or test the effect of a treatment or intervention on outcomes. |
| _Role in Experiment_ | Serve as a way to control for potential confounders and reduce bias. | Act as the independent variable(s) whose effect on the dependent variable is tested. |
| _Timing in Experiment_ | Applied before random assignment to ensure balanced groups. | Manipulated or measured during the experiment to observe their effect. |

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ **Key Idea:** Explanatory variables are factors tested for their impact, while blocking groups subjects to reduce confounding effects.
:::

## More Experimental Design Terminology

* **Placebo:** Fake treatment, often used as the control group in medical studies.
* **Placebo Effect:** Improvement observed in experimental units simply because they believe they are receiving special treatment.
* **Blinding:**	When experimental units do not know whether they are in the control or treatment group.
* **Double-Blind:**	When both the experimental units and the researchers interacting with them do not know who is in the control or treatment group.

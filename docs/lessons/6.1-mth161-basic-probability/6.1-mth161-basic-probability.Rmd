## Basic Probability Definition

**Probability** is the branch of mathematics that deals with randomness. The *likelihood* of an outcome happening.

An extent to which an outcome is likely to occur is $$\text{probability} = \frac{\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{total number of outcomes}}.$$

## Coin

**Fair Coin**

* *Possible outcomes:* $H$ or $T$ ($H$ for heads, $T$ for tails)
* *Total number of possible outcomes:* $2$
* *Probabilities:*
\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{probability of } H & = \frac{1}{2} \\
\text{probability of } T & = \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
\]

## Dice

**Fair Dice**

* *Possible outcomes:* 1 (&#9856;), 2 (&#9857;), 3 (&#9858;), 4 (&#9859;), 5 (&#9860;), or 6 (&#9861;)
* *Total number of possible outcomes:* $6$
* *Probabilities:*
\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{probability of } 1 & = \frac{1}{6} & \text{probability of } 4 & = \frac{1}{6} \\
\text{probability of } 2 & = \frac{1}{6} & \text{probability of } 5 & = \frac{1}{6} \\
\text{probability of } 3 & = \frac{1}{6} & \text{probability of } 6 & = \frac{1}{6}
\end{aligned}
\]

## Standard Deck of Cards

**52-Card Deck** 

* *Possible outcomes:* The four suits are Hearts (♥), Diamonds (♦), Clubs (♣), Spades (♠). Each suit has 13 ranks: Ace (A), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack (J), Queen (Q), and King (K).
* *Total number of possible outcomes:* $52$
* *Probabilities:*
\[
\text{probability of Q of Hearts } = \frac{1}{52}
\]
Actually, the probability of any card drawn once is $\frac{1}{52}$.

## Probability Notations (1/2)

We will use **specific words** for outcomes.

* A set of possible outcomes is called the **sample space**.
* Any subset of $S$ are called **events**.
* An **event space** is a set all subsets of outcomes of the sample space.

**Fair Coin Example:**

* Sample space: $S = \{H,T\}$
* Events space: $\{H\}$, $\{T\}$, $\{H,T\}$, $\emptyset$
* Two events from $S$: $\{H\}$ and $\{T\}$

## Probability Notations (2/2)

We will use **specific notations** for probabilities.

Let $A$ be an event with a finite sample space $S$. The probability of $A$ is $$P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} \longrightarrow P(A) = \frac{\text{number of outcome favorable to } A}{\text{total number of outcomes in } S}.$$

**Fair Coin Example:**

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{probability of } H & = \frac{1}{2} \longrightarrow P(H) = \frac{1}{2} \\
\text{probability of } T & = \frac{1}{2} \longrightarrow P(T) = \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
\]

## Independence

Two events, $A$ and $B$, are **independent** if the **occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other**: $$P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A)P(B)$$

If the event $B$ is **dependent** on $A$, then $$P(A \text{ and } B) \ne P(A)P(B)$$

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ **Key Idea:** Independent events is when one event happening does not affect the other. Disjoint events is when one event happening prevents the other.
:::

## Coin Flips

Suppose we conduct an experiment of flipping fair coins in sequence and record the outcomes.

* One Coin: $H$ or $T$ (two possible outcomes)
  - $P(H) = \frac{1}{2}$ and $P(T) = \frac{1}{2}$ but $P(H \text{ and } T) = 0$ because they can't occur simultaneously

* Two Coins: $HH$, $HT$, $TH$, or $TT$ (four possible outcomes)
  - $P(H \text{ and } H) = P(H)P(H) = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)$ because each flip is independent
  - $P(H \text{ and } T) = P(H)P(T) = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)$
  - $P(T \text{ and } H) = P(T)P(H) = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)$
  - $P(T \text{ and } T) = P(T)P(T) = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)$
  
::: {style="color: blue;"}
$\dagger$ How many possible outcomes are there for three coins and what are the probabilities? 
:::

## Disjoint and Joint Events

Two events, $A$ and $B$, are **disjoint** (or **mutually exclusive**) if they **cannot occur at the same time**: $$P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.$$

Two event, $A$ and $B$ are **joint** if they can happen together: $$P(A \text{ and } B) \ne 0$$

**Fair Coin Example:**

* $S = \{H,T\}$
* $P(H \text{ and } T) = 0$ since $H$ and $T$ outcomes cannot occur simultaneously in one flip

## Union of Events

The **union** of two events, $A$ and $B$, is the **event that at least one of them occurs**: $$P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)$$

If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then $$P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)$$

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ **Key Idea:** The probability of the union is the sum of individual probabilities minus their intersection (to avoid double-counting).

## Drawing Cards

Suppose we conduct an experiment of drawing specific characteristics of a card from a 52-card deck.

* Let $A$ be the event that we draw a Queen.
* Let $B$ be the event that we draw a Heart.
* Events $A$ and $B$ are joint.
    - $P(A \text{ and } B) = \frac{1}{52}$ (Queen of Hearts).
* We know that there are 4 Queens and 13 Hearts.
    - $P(A) = \frac{4}{52}$, $P(B) = \frac{13}{52}$, and 
    - $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B) = \frac{4}{52} + \frac{13}{52} - \frac{1}{52} = \frac{16}{52}$

$\dagger$ Can you compute the probability of drawing a face card (Ace, Jack, Queen, King) or a Diamond?
:::

## Dice Rolls

Suppose we conduct an experiment of rolling two six-sided dice and sum the outcomes.

* Each dice has six outcomes: 1 (&#9856;), 2 (&#9857;), 3 (&#9858;), 4 (&#9859;), 5 (&#9860;), or 6 (&#9861;)
* Let $A$ be the event of the 1st dice.
* Let $B$ be the event of the 2nd dice.
* The outcome we are interested in is the sum of $A$ and $B$. So, the sample space has 36 total possible outcomes.
    - The probability of getting a sum of 3 is $$\begin{aligned} P(3) & = P(1 \text{ and } 2) + P(2 \text{ and } 1) \\ & = P(1)P(2) + P(2)P(1) \\ & = \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) \\ & = 2 \times \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) \\ & = \frac{2}{36} \end{aligned}$$ because of independence and joint events.

## Summary of Basic Probability Rules

**Basic Rules**

| **Rule** | **Formula** |
|:---|:------|
| *Independence* | $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A)P(B)$ |
| *Joint (Union)* | $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)$ |
| *Disjoint* | $P(A \text{ and } B) = 0$ |
| *Complement* | If $P(A) + P(B) = 1$, then $1-P(A)=P(B)$. |

## Probability Axioms

| **Axiom** | **Statement** |
|:---|:------|
| $P(S) = 1$ | The sum of the probabilities for all outcomes in the sample space is equal to 1. |
| $P \in [0,1]$ | Probabilities are always positive and always between $0$ and $1$. |
| $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)$ | If events A and B are disjoint (mutually exclusive), then their probabilities can be added. |

## Interpreting Probability

**Frequentist probability** refers to the interpretation of probability based on the long-run frequency of an event occurring in repeated trials or experiments.

**Coin Flipping Example**

Suppose we conduct an experiment where we repeatedly flip a fair coin ($P(H) = 0.50$), tracking the cumulative count of $H$ and its proportion after each flip.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='70%', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("cumulative-fair-coin-flips-sim.gif")
```

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ **Key Idea:** As the number of flips (samples) increases the proportion of H gets closer and closer to the true proportion of H, which is $P(H)=0.50$.

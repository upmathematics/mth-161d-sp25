**Exploratory Analysis**

It is the process of analyzing and summarizing datasets to uncover patterns, trends, relationships, and anomalies before inference.

**Descriptive statistics**

It involves organizing, summarizing, and presenting data in an informative way. It Focuses on describing and understanding the main features of a dataset.

* If the distribution of data is **symmetric**, the **mean is often equal to the median, which is often equal to the mode**.
::::

## Variance (1/2)

**Variance** is roughly the average squared deviation from the mean.
$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$$

**Example:**

* The sample mean is $\bar{x} = 6.71$, and the sample size is $n = 217$.
* The variance of amount of sleep students get per night can be calculated as:

$$s^2 = \frac{(5 - 6.71)^2 + (9 - 6.71)^2 + \cdots + (7 - 6.71)^2}{217 - 1} = 4.11$$

## Variance (2/2)

**Why do we use the squared deviation in the calculation of variance?**

* To get rid of negatives so that observations equally distant from the mean are weighed equally.
* To weigh larger deviations more heavily.

## Standard Deviation

The **standard deviation** is the square root of the variance, and has the same units as the data.
$$s = \sqrt{s^2}$$

**Example:**

* We know that $s^2 = 4.11$.
* So, the standard deviation is $s = \sqrt{4.11} = 2.03$.

## Q1, Q3, and the IQR

* The **25th percentile** is also called the **first quartile**, $Q1$.
* The **50th percentile** is also called the **median**.
* The **75th percentile** is also called the **third quartile**, $Q3$.
* Between $Q1$ and $Q3$ is the middle 50% of the data. The range these data span is called the interquartile range, or the *IQR*.
$$IQR = Q3 - Q1$$

## Box Plots

The box in a **box plot** represents the middle 50% of the data, and the thick line in the box is the median.

```{r boxplot, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="", fig.align='center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("study_hours_box.png")
```

## Anatomy of Box Plots

```{r boxplot-layout, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="", fig.align='center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("study_hours_box_layout.png")
```

## Whiskers and Outliers

**Whiskers** of a box plot can extend up to 1.5 x IQR away from the quartiles.
$$\text{max upper whisker reach = Q3 + 1.5 x IQR}$$
$$\text{max lower whisker reach = Q1 - 1.5 x IQR}$$
$$\text{IQR: 20 - 10 = 10}$$
$$\text{max upper whisker reach = 20 + 1.5 x 10 = 35}$$
$$\text{max lower whisker reach = 10 - 1.5 x 10 = -5}$$

A potential **outlier** is defined as an observation beyond the maximum reach of the whiskers. It is an observation that appears extreme relative to the rest of the data.

## Why Outliers are Important?

**Why is it important to look for outliers?**

* Identify extreme skew in the distribution.
* Identify data collection and entry errors.
* Provide insight into interesting features of the data.

## Extreme Observations

How would sample statistics such as mean, median, SD, and IQR of household income be affected if the largest value was replaced with $10 million? What if the smallest value was replaced with \$10 million?

```{r house_income_dot_stacked, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="", fig.align='center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("house_income_dot_stacked.png")
```

## Robust Statistics (1/2)

```{r robust-table, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="", fig.align='center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("robust-table.png")
```

## Robust Statistics (2/2)

Median and IQR are more robust to skewness and outliers than mean and SD. Therefore,

* for skewed distributions it is often more helpful to use median and IQR to describe the center and spread
* for symmetric distributions it is often more helpful to use the mean and SD to describe the center and spread
